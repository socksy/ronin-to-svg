# A converter from ronin to svg
I used https://hundredrabbits.github.io/Ronin/ to generate my favicon logo for my website, but it only seems to export to png. That comes up a bit pixelly on Firefox, so I want to try an SVG version.

This script was initially generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet, with some modifications by me to make it work, and to make it make sense. Use it at your own risk. Provided under MIT license.

## Usage

```
./ronin-to-svg.bb favicon.ronin
```
